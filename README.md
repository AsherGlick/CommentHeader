CommentHeader
=============

A quick script for creating nice looking comments in code




This program is written in c++

it is run with the arguments `./comment_header` Title With Spaces  
all but one space will be ignored if there are multiples in series  
`./commnet_header -h` will display a help message  
`./comment_header` with no argumetns will display a help message  
This will print a comment headder with the requested name  

Due to more interest in this project I may begin documenting this and writing it better
